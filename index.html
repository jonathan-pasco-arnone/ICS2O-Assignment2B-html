    <h2>Quote:</h2>
    <p2><i><q>Chess is far too complex to be definitively
    solved with any technology we can conceive of today. However, our looked-down-upon
    cousin, checkers, or draughts, suffered this fate quite recently thanks to the
    work of Jonathan Schaeffer at the University of Alberta and his unbeatable program
    Chinook.</i></q></p2>
